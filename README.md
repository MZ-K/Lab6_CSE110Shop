# Lab6_CSE110Shop

For some reason, the fakeshopapi.com link wasn't working for me. So Camdyn Rasque helped me set up a local API to complete the lab. So I did that, switching the local API's url with the original API's. Since the issue of the fakeshopapi.com link not working was a local issue on my side, hopefully my code will work fine on someone else's system. But I haven't tested my code on the original API because I couldn't.
